## 💭 How it works <a name = "working"></a>

<p align="justify">You must first add a <b>Schedule</b> which represents the follow-up of a given budget. It is also necessary to specify a <b>starting capital</b>.
Once this schedule has been created, you can add <b>transactions</b> that represent the inputs and outputs made on the budget. Capital is therefore the first transaction.
Schedules can be changed afterwards.</p>
